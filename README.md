# Hannibal
Hannibal is a generals.io bot and framework that me and @Pixelz22 are working on.
It uses selenium for browser interactions


## Features
* Can imitate humans by using browser interactions and HTML parsing
* Relatively speedy (1.5ms to retrieve moves / update board state, 4ms to play moves)
* Designed to be modular from the ground up, with more features coming


## Roadmap
- [x] basic backend features (still buggy with simulation)
- [] functional backend
- [] GUI to visualize (as well as backend functions to interface) probably gonna use pygame
- [x] test bot
- [] mcts?
- [] modular strategy (@Pixelz22)
- [] nn if I can get Xiyue to do it


I have a newer version of this code locally, and I will update this repository when I complete an alpha version of the backend, as well as creating a `dev` branch and restructuring.

NB: this is not my primary focus, my intership is
